“সোলজার” is an adventure-style game. Here is a character named Soldier who has to go to a certain destination from the beginning. 
We use here (graphical Work, Linear algebra and vector method, FOL-First order logic (robotics & automatism)) and also usable different algorithm to implement our game successfully. 
And the coding language of the game will must be Java and Java swing.


Uses of Algorithm:
Linear Algebra: In this game the linear Algebra help me to declare and assign variable and also use them different in different class.
Vector Method: Vector method is a method which declare the Vector of moving. We can move left, right, up, down by using this.
Animation & Robotics: For soldier robotics algorithm are works  for jump, shoot, visible or divisible etc.
